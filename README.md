How do I approach designing software?
  When designing software I make sure to check with the documentation given to ensure that I know the desired results.  From there I break down the steps of how to build my project or application to ensure proper results.  Once that is done I work on building my program and fix any bugs and errors that arise until I get the desired result. 
  
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  I was able to learn how to build and move objects on a 3D plane.  
  
What design process did you follow for your project work?
  First I took a picture of objects that have meaning to me.  From there I build each shape one at a time, some were simple and others were multiple objects. Once the shapes were added to the screen I adjusted their texture of them as well as the size.
  
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  The tactics that I can apply in the future are how I took the project and broke it down into steps. The steps are what allowed me to build my project one step at a time. 
  
How do I approach developing programs?  
  When developing a program I make sure to follow best standard practices as well as making clean code. From there I take the whole project and break it down into steps that will help me achieve the desired outcome.
  
How did iteration factor into your development?
  I had four iterations of code that included inserting shapes, movement, texture, and lighting. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  My apporoch to developing code throughout the milestones stayed the same.  Focus on one step of the project at a time and it will eventually come to completion. 
  
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Computer science is something that can and does solve many problems around the world. I want to own my own company one day and I can use technology to help me build solutions to a problem I need fixed.  I can also use the lessons I have learned in developing code to overcome challenges as well as how to build projects. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Anytime you learn anything there are always lessons that we can take from class to class.
